rtdir.sh changes the seeding directory of your files based on a search string,
such as a tracker, which can be regular expression. It should be run in your
rtorrent session directory, while rtorrent is closed. As always, do a backup
beforehand.

Usage takes the form
$ rtdir.sh [search string] [new path]
be sure to escape the search string or path as necessary.
