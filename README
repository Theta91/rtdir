rtdir.sh changes the seeding directory of your files based on a search string,
such as a tracker, which can be regular expression. It should be run in your
rtorrent session directory, while rtorrent is closed. As always, do a backup
beforehand.

Usage takes the form
$ rtdir.sh [search string] [new path]
be sure to escape the search string or path as necessary.

The search string is applied to the *.torrent files in rtorrent's session
directory. The only real information available in those files is the tracker,
folder name, and contents of the torrent. If you'd like to change paths based on
some other metric, such as time finished or current directory, you must change
line 37, so that the search is applied to *.rtorrent.
